# 1. What is an Array, what is a Hash, and how are they different?   

# For questions 2 and 3, consider the following array of hashes:

heroes = [
    {
        name: 'Iron Man',
        age: 48
    },
    {
        name: 'Thor',
        age: 1035
    },
    {
        name: 'Hulk',
        age: 49
    },
    {
        name: 'Spiderman',
        age: 15
    }
]

# 2. Write a function which, given the above array of heroes as an argument,
#    returns the oldest hero from the array.

# 3. Write a function which, given the above array of heroes and the name of a 
#    hero as arguments, returns the age of that hero.

# 4. Write a function which, given the above array of heroes, returns the name of  
#    the first hero in the array
