# Web Development Fundamentals Interview

**These are the interview instructions and rubric. You should not need to share this README with a student**
**The questions to share are in `index.rb`**

An interview template to use when determining whether a student has properly prepared themselves for the bootcamp since passing their technical interview.

### Question 1 
This question is completely theoretical, mostly an opportunity to catch any major red flags. No grading requirement for this one.

### Question 2 
This question is the hardest, will most likely take some assistance, and is an opportunity to gauge a students coachability in person. *Please* guide the student towards iteratively testing as they write this method. No grading requirement for this question either- it is primarily here to help prepare students for the final two questions.

### Question 3 
This question is easier than question 2, and should be administered with the Code Challenge retake philosophy- an interviewer can *sparingly* ask questions to help get past syntax errors, but under no circumstances should things devolve to an explanation of how the code should work. 

On there own, the student should be able to recognize:
* The need for iteration (ideally using `.find`, but a loop will do if they know how to use it)
* What they are iterating over (that each hero is a hash)
* How to get the name for that hero (using `[:name]`)
* How to write the condition to find the requested hero
* How to return the hero once it is found

Do not use these terms, unless the student uses the term correctly first:
* array
* iterator
* index
* element
* hash
* symbol

Do not use these terms in any case:
* move your cursor to (some position in code)
* write: (some code)

If they can't complete this deliverable on their own, they are a possible candidate for defferment. If nothing else, we will want to check in early with this student to avoid them falling farther behind. The student should be informed that they do not possess recommended proficiency, and that the next few days will be critical for their future success in the course.

### Question 4
This is the easiest of the questions and should be completed with **no assstance**, other than clarifying the question. 
When clarifying the question, do not use these terms, unless the student uses the term correctly first:
* array
* iterator
* index
* element
* hash
* symbol

If a student cannot synthesize the logic required to meet this deliverable, then they are definitely missing foundational concepts, without which they would be at a severe disadvantage for the duration of the course. The education team should advise deferment to the next cohort.
