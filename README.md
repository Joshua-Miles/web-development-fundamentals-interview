# Web Development Fundamentals Interview

**These are the interview instructions and rubric. You should not need to share this README with a student**

An interview template to use when determining whether a student has properly prepared themselves for the bootcamp since passing their technical interview.

* Question 1 is completely theoretical, mostly an opportunity to catch any major red flags.
* Question 2 is the hardest, will most likely take some assistance, and is an opportunity to gauge a students coachability in person. *Please* guide the student towards iteratively testing as they write this method.
* Question 3 is easier than question 2, and should be administered with the Code Challenge retake philosophy- an interviewer can *sparingly* ask questions to help get past syntax errors, but under no circumstances should things devolve to an explanation of how the code should work. If a student cannot synthesize the logic required to meet this deliverable after completeting question 2 with assistance, then they are likely missing foundational concepts, without which they would be at a severe disadvantage for the duration of the course. In this case we would advise deferment to the next cohort.
